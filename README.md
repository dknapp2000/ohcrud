## ohCrud - a generalized CRUD generator/restful interface to a postgresql database

Targeted options are:

- Read only flag
- Page/form flag to display a complete web page or a form that can be inserted
- Check for a format table in the DB that can control form generation

Question: should this produce react compatible code?  Yeah, probably.
