## ohCrud - a generalized CRUD generator/restful interface to a postgresql database

Targeted options are:

- Read only flag
- Page/form flag to display a complete web page or a form that can be inserted
- Check for a format table in the DB that can control form generation
- Output format flag: html, react, (hbs?)

Queston: since this is meant to be a service, how do we manage access?

- OAuth2 ?
- Webtoken ?
